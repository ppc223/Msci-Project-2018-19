Full set of code created for the project.

WLN Inital Learning Notebooks folder contains the notebooks used for learning how to use Qutip 
and initally trying to calculate the Wigner Logarithmic Negativity

Code Folder Contains the actual code used to obtain results (along with all the data generated)

The Main files are as follows:
analytic_cubic.py - Calculations for the Mana of the cubic phase state over the state
generating parameters using an analytic approach

numerical_cubic.py - Same as above but using a numerical approach

innercubic.py - Same as numerical_cubic but for the Triple Photon State (what I was calling
the inner cubic state)

func.py - Many functions used throughout multiple files, mostly relating to generation of 
states and generic calculation of the Mana

Data-Analysis.ipynb - Notebook for analysis of the data.


These aren't all fully commented to the degree I intend to submit them with but they do
have a good amount of comments and any suggestions for where more are needed are welcome!
