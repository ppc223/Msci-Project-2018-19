# Msci Project 2018/19 on Resource Theories for Wigner Negativity
Full set of code created for my Msci project.

The Main files are as follows:
analytic_cubic.py - Calculations for the Mana of the cubic phase state over the state
generating parameters using an analytic approach

numerical_cubic.py - Same as above but using a numerical approach

innercubic.py - Same as numerical_cubic but for the Triple Photon State (what I was calling
the inner cubic state)

func.py - Many functions used throughout multiple files, mostly relating to generation of 
states and generic calculation of the Mana

Data-Analysis.ipynb - Notebook for analysis of the data.

Plotting.ipynb - Notebook for generation of plots included in the project report
